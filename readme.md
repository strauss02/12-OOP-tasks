So why the hell should I use this OOP thingy?

1.Easier trouble shooting - the use of classes allows encapsulation - which means problems are contained to a certain scope and are easier to trace down.

2. Easy to avoid code duplication - classes inherit their methods and properties down the bloodline, which means that every subclass automatically gets out-of-the-box features that were already written before.

3. Reusable yet flexible - subclasses can access every feature of their ancestors, and yet still redefine every property and method flawlessly.

4. Pragmatic and solution oriented - breaking every little piece of your code into classes makes the longest of codes maintainable and readable.
